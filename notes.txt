Current Functionality:
    -A systemd service on tacoma initiates a python script, which reads and inserts data into db
        -Python script reads and inserts data into db, exits, and logs errors and info to file
        -systemd service restarts on failure, 60 second restart interval
        -A systemd timer is needed to control the run interval (every 60 seconds) since
            the python script does not contain while loop
        -A bash script on homeserver initiates rsync to sync tacoma db to a local db
            -This also requires a systemd timer, as cron does not allow 5 minute intervals as desired

Current Issues:

To Do:
DONE    -udev rule
DONE    -systemd service and timer for remote (tacoma), running successfully every 30s
DONE    -systemd servie / timer to run syncdb script (homeserver)
DONE    - Create visualizations:
DONE    - Research Vis options (Graphana? Matplotlib? ...)
        - Integrate with Homeassistant dashboard. 
    -Need to mess with smoothing some of the data with a rolling average
        which would make the grafana graphs more readable potentially. 
    -Would be cool to find a way to rsync to server via my phone (termux background process) and vpn


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    - remote machine (tacoma):
        - pull github repo 
        - symlink logger.service and logger.timer to appropriate systemd directory (what is this?)
        - systemctl enable + start logger.service

    - local machine (homeserver):
        - pull github repo
        - symlink syncdb script into PATH
        - symlink syncdb.service, syncdb.timer into appropriate systemd directory (where?)
        - systemctl enable + start syncdb.service, systemctl daemon-reload
